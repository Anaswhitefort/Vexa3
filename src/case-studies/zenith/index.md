We went through the product back and forth, wrapping functionalities into thoughtful UI and robust UX patterns, solving problems its sole maintainer had been finding himself short-handed to work on, and soon enough Drone v1.0 was available to the community. As a cherry on top, we supplied Drone with a beautiful landing page, which, paired with refined product, immediately brought mature look to the company. Eventually all this led to Drone acquisition by Harness Inc.

We continued working together later on: first we took part in developing Harness CI/CD proprietary solutions, then got back working on Drone v2.0 redesign once more, introducing long-awaited features to the community. This version is available to public now.
