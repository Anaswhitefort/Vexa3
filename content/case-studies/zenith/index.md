It all began in 2021, when a group of PostreSQL contributors and technologists set up on a mission to create an OS cloud-native database as a service available for every developer. They united under the brand name called Zenith. We joined the team shortly after they had made a successful series A financing, with intention to help them establish a proper brand image.

Marketing platform was the first priority as an attraction of the early-birds customers is crucial for any startup company. We put stakes on bold typography, colorful collages as the opposite of typical techie illustrations that are being used for websites of this area, and balanced it out with glitchy animations, preserving “deep tech” feeling for visitors.

The product design was next on the queue. Despite it made an impression of a typical dashboard with a bunch of controls, we had to keep in mind that the product itself was at the very beginning of development and there are many more features lie ahead, so the design system had to be planned accordingly. We made sure it could cover up a huge variety of interface elements, from a tooltip to complex analytic graphs, so that every further functionality extension can be represented to user in a consistent manner.
